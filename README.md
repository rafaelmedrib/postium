## Introduction
You can’t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families. (Jim McCarthy) In order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion. (Anonymous) I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing. (Oktal) Any fool can use a computer. Many do. (Ted Nelson)
> Computers are getting smarter all the time. Scientists tell us that soon they will be able to talk to us. (And by ‘they’, I mean ‘computers’. I doubt scientists will ever be able to talk to us.) (Dave Barry)

The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) But what is it good for? (Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM, commenting on the microchip, 1968) Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a job. (Mosher’s Law of Software Engineering) Programming is like sex: one mistake and you’re providing support for a lifetime. (Michael Sinz) I think there’s a world market for about 5 computers. (Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of the Board, IBM, circa 1948)

## Instalation

(Jessica Gaston) Come to think of it, there are already a million monkeys on a million typewriters, and Usenet is nothing like Shakespeare. (Blair Houghton)

## Usage
Microsoft has a new version out, Windows XP, which according to everybody is the ‘most reliable Windows ever.’ To me, this is like saying that asparagus is ‘the most articulate vegetable ever.’ (Dave Barry) The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple. (Grady Booch) Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more ‘user-friendly’… Their best approach so far has been to take all the old brochures and stamp the words ‘user-friendly’ on the cover. (Bill Gates) There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone. (Bjarne Stroustrup) Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Martin Golding)
